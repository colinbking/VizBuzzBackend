# What is VizBuzz? 
VizBuzz is a mobile app that brings the intricacies and nuances of audio podcasts to those who are deaf or hard of hearing. By providing a real time, enhanced transcription system, users can glean insight into auditory subtleties via visual cues. For example, a positive sentiment can be indicated by green text, whereas a negative phrase can be illustrated with red. VizBuzz provides a way for users to upload any podcast they wish, then have the option to play it back alongside the enhanced transcript.
